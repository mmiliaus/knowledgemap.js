# About
Inspired by the [Constellation Knowledge](http://bjk5.com/post/1664635835/constellation-knowledge).

The goal is to have a more usable visualization of data with parent-child relationships.

# How to use
The library is pretty straight forward. The following [example](https://github.com/mmiliaus/knowledgemap.js/blob/master/example.html) as a reference on how to use this lib.
