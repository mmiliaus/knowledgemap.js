# About
Inspired by [http://bjk5.com/post/1664635835/constellation-knowledge](Constellation Knowledge). 

Idea is to have more usable visualization of data with parent-child relationships.

# How to use
Library is pretty straight forward. Following [https://github.com/mmiliaus/knowledgemap.js/blob/master/example.html](example) can be used to see how to use it.
